# AerosolWaterUptake

This repository contains the MATLAB files to determine aerosol droplet growth and optical properties, and is a supplementary to the manuscript "Predicting Effect of Organic-Inorganic Internally Mixed Particles on Water Uptake and Optical Properties of Atmospheric Aerosols ".

The main code file is WaterUptakeOpticalProperties with submodules MolalityMixture, DensityMixture and WaterActivity to determine the water uptake by each particle depending on particle size, composition and relative humidity. The optical properties are calculated by Mie and Miecoated submodules.
