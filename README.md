# AerosolWaterUptake
This contains the MATLAB files to determine aerosol droplet growth and optical properties.

The main code is WaterUptakeOpticalProperties with submodules MolalityMixture, DensityMixture and WaterActivity to determine the water uptake by each paeticke depending on particle size, composition and relative humidity.
Optical properties are calculated by Mie and Miecoated submodules.
